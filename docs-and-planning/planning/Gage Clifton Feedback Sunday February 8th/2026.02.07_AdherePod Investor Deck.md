THE PROBLEM

Medication Non-Adherence: A \$528 Billion Crisis

![preencoded.png](ppt/media/image2.png "Image 0")

50%

of chronic disease patients

don\'t take meds as prescribed

![preencoded.png](ppt/media/image3.png "Image 1")

\$528B

annual cost of

non-adherence in the U.S.

![preencoded.png](ppt/media/image4.png "Image 2")

100K+

preventable deaths

per year

![preencoded.png](ppt/media/image5.png "Image 3")

25%

of U.S. hospitalizations

caused by non-adherence

Non-adherence is the single largest driver of avoidable healthcare spending --- yet most payers lack the tools to address it effectively at scale.

## Slide 3

THE PAYER OPPORTUNITY

\$100--\$300B

in potential annual savings for payers by systematically addressing medication adherence

![preencoded.png](ppt/media/image6.png "Image 0")

Medicare Star Ratings

Adherence is a key quality metric --- small improvements can be the difference between 3 and 4 stars, unlocking significant bonus payments

![preencoded.png](ppt/media/image7.png "Image 1")

Proven ROI

Medicare plans avoided \$27--\$46.6B in costs (2013--2018) from better adherence in just 3 drug classes

![preencoded.png](ppt/media/image8.png "Image 2")

Value-Based Alignment

Better adherence = fewer hospitalizations, fewer ER visits, lower total cost of care --- a direct win for risk-bearing payers

\"Even small shifts in adherence can be the difference between 3 and 4 stars\... that\'s a return you don\'t walk away from.\"

--- Becker\'s Payer Issues
