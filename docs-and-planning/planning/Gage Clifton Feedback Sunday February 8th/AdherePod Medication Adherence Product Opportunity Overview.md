# The Cost of Poor Medication Adherence for Payers

Medication non-adherence -- patients not taking prescriptions as
directed -- is a widespread and costly problem in healthcare. Only about
half of patients with chronic diseases take their medications
consistently as prescribed. The consequences are severe: non-adherence
is estimated to contribute to at least 100,000 preventable deaths each
year and adds over \$100 billion in avoidable medical costs annually in
the United States. When considering the full downstream impacts,
including increased illness and mortality, the total cost of poor
adherence has been estimated at \$528.4 billion per year. Non-adherence
is also responsible for roughly 25% of U.S. hospitalizations each year,
as patients who skip medications often suffer complications that lead to
expensive acute care.

For health insurers and payers, this represents a massive opportunity
for both cost savings and quality improvement. Analysts estimate that
systematically addressing medication adherence could save \$100--\$300
billion in healthcare costs annually by preventing hospitalizations,
complications, and disease progression. These savings directly benefit
payers, who bear the cost of avoidable emergency visits, hospital stays,
and advanced treatments when patients' conditions worsen due to missed
medications.

Payers are increasingly incentivized to improve adherence. In Medicare
Advantage and Part D plans, medication adherence is a key quality
metric. Between 2013 and 2018, Medicare plans avoided an estimated
\$27--\$46.6 billion in healthcare costs thanks to improved adherence in
just three drug classes: diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol
medications. Even small improvements can be meaningful -- modest shifts
in adherence can be the difference between three and four stars in
Medicare's five-star quality ratings. Achieving four or more stars earns
plans significant bonus payments and enrollment advantages, creating a
strong financial motive to boost members' medication compliance.

In short, better medication use leads to healthier members and lower
downstream costs by preventing hospitalizations and complications. This
combination of avoided medical expenses and quality incentives makes
medication adherence a multi-billion-dollar value proposition for
payers.

# AdherePod: A Seamless Medication Adherence Solution

AdherePod is a hardware-enabled solution designed to dramatically
improve medication adherence, especially for older and chronically ill
patients. It is a smart in-home pill dispenser with an integrated
screen, camera, and connectivity -- engineered to make the entire
experience as seamless as possible for the end user. The device works
right out of the box with minimal setup, anticipating the needs and
limitations of patients who may not be tech-savvy.

For example, AdherePod can come with built-in cellular or satellite
internet connectivity. If using Wi-Fi, it can automatically text the
user's phone to request the Wi-Fi password and configure itself, or even
use voice commands, so the patient doesn't have to struggle with manuals
or apps to get it online. Once up and running, AdherePod serves as an
all-in-one medication management assistant.

## Key Features

### Effortless Medication Enrollment

Using its built-in camera, AdherePod can scan the label of a
prescription bottle that a patient holds up to it. The system uses
optical recognition to identify the medication name and dosage
instructions, automatically adding that drug to the patient's regimen.
This saves the user from having to manually input their medication
schedule and reduces errors, ensuring the device knows exactly what the
medication is and when it should be taken.

### Automated Dispensing and Smart Reminders

AdherePod physically stores and dispenses pills at scheduled times. When
it's time for a dose, the device alerts the patient via a chime or voice
prompt and a notification on the screen. If the patient doesn't take the
pill from the dispenser, AdherePod can send a text message or automated
phone call as a reminder. Research has shown that text message reminders
can double the odds of a patient taking medications as prescribed. By
ensuring timely dosing, AdherePod helps prevent missed doses or
double-dosing confusion. It can also notify a caregiver or family member
if doses are missed, providing an added layer of support.

### Personalized Guidance and Education

Many patients struggle with how to take their medications -- whether to
take them with food, whether it's safe to combine certain pills, and so
on. AdherePod acts as a friendly medication coach. Its screen displays
simple instructions, including large text for the visually impaired, and
its voice assistant can speak directly to the patient. Upon dispensing a
pill, AdherePod might say: "It's time to take your Metformin. Remember
to take it with a meal." The device can also answer basic questions and
give reminders about avoiding certain interactions or watching for side
effects. By providing this real-time guidance, AdherePod helps eliminate
confusion, which is a known barrier to adherence.

### Refill Coordination with Pharmacies

Running out of a medication is a common cause of non-adherence.
AdherePod takes on the logistics of refills by tracking how many doses
remain. When a medication is running low, it can automatically contact
the patient's pharmacy or mail-order service to request a refill through
an internet API integration or by placing an automated call. It can
check the number of refills remaining on the prescription and alert the
patient ahead of time if a doctor's renewal is needed. By proactively
handling refills, AdherePod ensures patients don't unintentionally lapse
in therapy.

### Price Shopping and Cost Savings

Cost is the leading factor behind many patients' failure to take
medications. AdherePod helps address this by finding cheaper options.
The device can link to services that compare drug prices at local and
online pharmacies or apply discount programs. For example, if a
patient's brand-name medication is expensive, AdherePod might suggest:
"Your medication costs \$100 at Pharmacy A but only \$50 at Pharmacy B
nearby. Would you like us to transfer your prescription?" It could also
alert patients to generic alternatives or patient assistance programs.
By reducing the financial burden of medications, this feature tackles a
major root cause of non-adherence. Any savings found benefit both the
patient and the payer.

### Integration with Providers and Prior Authorization

Some adherence issues require coordination with healthcare providers,
such as when a prescription expires or needs prior authorization for
more refills. AdherePod can streamline these tasks by notifying the
doctor's office that a patient needs a new prescription or prior
authorization approval, sending the necessary details electronically. If
needed, AdherePod will notify the patient and offer to facilitate a call
to the doctor's office. This concierge function relieves patients --
especially those with cognitive or energy limitations -- from the burden
of paperwork and phone tag, further smoothing the adherence journey.

### Data Analytics and Reporting

Because AdherePod tracks every dose, it creates a rich dataset on actual
medication-taking behavior. With appropriate privacy safeguards, this
adherence data is extremely valuable to payers and providers. Care
managers can be alerted in real time if a patient is repeatedly missing
doses, allowing timely intervention. Over time, data on which patients
struggle most with adherence can help insurers target additional support
or disease management programs. AdherePod can also generate reports for
physicians, so at appointments the doctor can see the patient's recent
adherence trends and adjust treatment accordingly.

As more direct-to-consumer medications emerge -- such as certain GLP-1
weight-loss drugs that patients often pay for out of pocket -- payers
currently lack visibility into whether those drugs are being taken,
because they don't appear in insurance claims. AdherePod fills this gap
by capturing usage data for all medications a patient takes, not just
those billed to insurance. One major insurer's analysis found that only
22% of its members had insurance coverage for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs,
meaning the majority who use these medications do so outside their
health plan. AdherePod's monitoring of such medications could inform
payers about adherence and outcomes for therapies they otherwise
wouldn't see. In aggregate, anonymized adherence data could be made
available to pharmaceutical companies or researchers interested in
real-world medication usage patterns, creating a potential revenue
stream while improving healthcare insights.

## Design Philosophy and Early Evidence

AdherePod's design directly addresses the known barriers to medication
adherence: it simplifies complex regimens, provides reminders and
education, reduces cost hurdles, and bridges communication gaps between
patients, pharmacies, and doctors. The entire user experience is
designed to be plug-and-play -- once the device is plugged in, the
patient essentially has a personal medication assistant managing the
routine.

Early evidence from similar devices demonstrates this approach can yield
outstanding results. In a recent pilot study, a group of older adults
with an average age of approximately 66 using a smart dispenser achieved
an average adherence rate of 98% over six months -- near-perfect
adherence. Over 90% of participants rated the device as easy and simple
to use, demonstrating that with thoughtful design, seniors can
comfortably adopt high-tech solutions. By delivering medications on
schedule and keeping patients engaged, AdherePod can significantly boost
adherence rates, leading to better health outcomes and lower healthcare
costs.

# Leveraging Federal Rural Health Funding

To accelerate AdherePod's impact and business growth, we can tap into
new federal funding targeted at improving healthcare in underserved
areas. In late 2025, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
announced the Rural Health Transformation Program, a \$50 billion
initiative aimed at strengthening and modernizing healthcare in rural
communities. This program will distribute funds over five years
(2026--2030) to all 50 states -- roughly \$10 billion per year, with
each state receiving an annual award of approximately \$100--\$280
million in the first year to support rural health improvements.

One of the stated uses of this funding is to upgrade technology and care
delivery models in rural areas. CMS has explicitly highlighted that
states can use Rural Transformation dollars to modernize rural health
infrastructure and technology and to expand telehealth, remote patient
monitoring, and digital tools that enable timely access to care.
AdherePod aligns directly with these goals.

## Strategic Alignment with Rural Health Priorities

### Expanding Access for Rural Patients

Rural populations often face geographic barriers -- the nearest clinic
or pharmacy may be far away, and transportation can be difficult for
elderly or disabled patients. AdherePod helps bring healthcare into the
home by dispensing medications on-site and providing telehealth-like
support. It ensures patients in remote locations can manage their
treatments without constant travel, supporting the program's aim to
bring more care within reach of rural Americans. An AdherePod in a rural
household serves as a compact pharmacy and health assistant, bridging
gaps in access.

### Remote Patient Monitoring and Early Intervention

Because AdherePod reports in real time whether a patient is taking their
medications, healthcare providers can use it as a remote monitoring
tool. A rural health clinic could deploy AdherePods to patients with
chronic conditions such as heart failure or diabetes and receive alerts
if those patients miss critical medications. This enables a nurse or
care manager to follow up quickly, potentially preventing an ER visit or
hospitalization. Such treat-in-place and early intervention capabilities
are exactly what rural health initiatives aim to promote. Keeping
patients healthy at home reduces strain on rural hospitals, and
AdherePod data could integrate with statewide health information
exchanges to flag adherence issues across the rural population.

### Supporting the Rural Healthcare Workforce

Many rural areas are grappling with shortages of healthcare
professionals. By automating routine tasks -- medication dispensing,
adherence tracking, and refill coordination -- AdherePod can reduce the
workload on rural pharmacists, nurses, and doctors. Instead of a nurse
spending time each week calling patients to check if they took their
medications, AdherePod handles day-to-day prompts and flags the nurse
only when there's an issue. This makes care delivery more efficient,
helping stretched rural providers extend their reach. The federal
funding priorities include reducing burdens on clinicians through
technology and digital tools, and AdherePod fits that mandate by taking
over routine medication management tasks.

### Innovative Care Models and Value-Based Care

States receiving the rural health funds are encouraged to pilot new care
models and payment models that improve outcomes. AdherePod could be
incorporated into value-based care programs in rural areas -- for
example, a Medicare Advantage plan or an Accountable Care Organization
operating in rural counties might distribute AdherePods to high-risk
patients. The improved adherence would likely lead to fewer hospital
admissions and better chronic disease metrics, helping these
organizations achieve quality targets and shared savings. The upfront
cost of the devices could be covered by rural funding as part of an
innovation or pilot project, given the clear connection to improved
patient outcomes.

## Accessing the Funding

To tap into this opportunity, AdherePod's strategy would involve working
with state health departments and rural healthcare consortia. Every
state has submitted a plan for how it intends to use its Rural
Transformation allotment. We should identify states that emphasized
digital health, telemedicine, or chronic disease management in their
proposals -- those states are ideal partners for a pilot deployment.

For instance, a state could allocate a portion of its approximately
\$200 million yearly grant to provide 5,000 AdherePod units to rural
residents with high medication burdens, such as seniors on multiple
prescriptions. We could also partner with rural hospitals or federally
qualified health centers (FQHCs), which might apply for sub-grants or
state-level programs funded by this initiative. By demonstrating that
AdherePod can improve medication adherence and health outcomes in their
community, those providers make a strong case for funding under the
innovation and modernization umbrellas of the program.

All 50 states are receiving some funding, so the market for
rural-focused solutions is nationwide. Some less-populous states may
have smaller absolute grants but could invest more per capita; others
with large rural populations have the biggest allocations. There is
broad bipartisan support for investing in rural health, so we anticipate
sustained political will to make these projects successful. By aligning
AdherePod with these public health goals, we not only unlock grant
funding but also gain credibility and a pathway to scale. Successful
state-funded pilots could lead to larger contracts or insurance
reimbursement for the device as a covered benefit in rural health plans.

# Conclusion

Medication adherence is both a profound healthcare challenge and a
fertile opportunity for innovation. For payers, the stakes are enormous
-- hundreds of billions of dollars are wasted each year on avoidable
complications of non-adherence, while improved adherence translates
directly into better patient outcomes and lower costs. AdherePod is
positioned to solve this problem at scale by providing patients with an
easy-to-use, nearly hands-free system that ensures they take their
treatments properly.

By tackling the practical barriers -- forgetfulness, complexity, cost,
and access -- AdherePod can significantly raise adherence rates, meaning
fewer hospital visits and healthier, more stable members for insurers.
In an era where healthcare is shifting to value-based models, this is
exactly the kind of solution that payers are eager to support.

The timing for AdherePod's launch is advantageous. With \$50 billion in
new federal funding flowing into modernizing healthcare for rural and
underserved communities, there is a ready avenue to finance deployment
of this technology where it's needed most. These public investments can
de-risk and accelerate AdherePod's rollout, allowing us to demonstrate
real-world impact on patient outcomes and healthcare costs. By
leveraging these programs, AdherePod could quickly become an integral
part of rural healthcare delivery and beyond, supported by government
and payer stakeholders alike.

Improving medication adherence represents a multi-billion-dollar
opportunity for healthcare payers, and AdherePod offers a compelling
solution to capture that value. By combining cutting-edge technology
with user-centric design, we improve patients' lives while delivering
economic benefits to those who pay for care. Coupling this with
strategic use of federal funding amplifies our ability to scale and
succeed. AdherePod stands at the intersection of a pressing healthcare
need, a large addressable market, and supportive tailwinds from both
industry and government. With this approach, we aim to drive better
health outcomes on a grand scale -- and in doing so, build a company
that is both profitable and transformative for the healthcare system.
