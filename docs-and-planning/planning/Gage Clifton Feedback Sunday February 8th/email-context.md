Here is the WIP Investor deck.

We need more on competitor analysis and differentiation with these (and other) companies:
1. [MedaCube](https://www.medacube.com/)
2. [Hero](https://herohealth.com/)
3. [MedMinder](https://medminder.com/)

My initial thoughts as to how we differentiate:

1. AI-native adherence intelligence, not timers and buzzers
2. Scan-and-go onboarding with zero setup, no app, no caregiver
3. Full concierge automation across refills, price shopping, prior auths, and provider outreach
4. Real-time dose-level data on all medications, including out-of-pocket drugs invisible to claims
