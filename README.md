# AdherePod

A voice-native, plug-and-play medical adherence device and data platform. Designed for elderly and low-literacy users who need frictionless health management — no apps, no menus, no confusion.

## Vision

AdherePod is a dedicated hardware device (not a phone app) that sits in a patient's home and becomes their personal health hub. It connects to pill dispensers, blood pressure monitors, glucose meters, wearables, and other medical devices — then turns that data into a unified platform for providers and payers.

The phone form factor is too confusing for elders and low-literacy populations. AdherePod is **frictionless, plug-and-play, and voice-native**.

## Core Features

### 1. Voice-Native Interface
- All interactions happen through natural voice conversation
- No screens to navigate, no apps to download, no buttons to press
- "AdherePod, what pills do I take this morning?"
- "AdherePod, my blood pressure reading is ready"
- Supports multiple languages and dialects

### 2. Medical Device Integration
- Connects to blood pressure monitors, glucose meters, pulse oximeters, scales
- Syncs with wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.)
- Integrates with smart pill dispensers
- Automatic data capture — no manual entry

### 3. Medication Management
- Voice-guided pill identification and scheduling
- Automated reminders through the device speaker
- Cross-references all medications for dangerous interactions
- Flags advisories to discuss with your doctor

### 4. Adherence Tracking
- Logs medication doses, vitals, and device readings automatically
- Builds a comprehensive health adherence score
- Tracks trends over time (blood pressure patterns, medication consistency, etc.)

### 5. Data Platform for Providers & Payers
- Real-time dashboard for physicians to monitor patient adherence and vitals
- Shares anonymized adherence data with insurance providers
- Surfaces cheaper medication alternatives covered by the patient's plan
- Identifies discounts and savings programs through insurance
- Enables value-based care models with verified adherence data
