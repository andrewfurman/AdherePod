**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Duration:** ~33 minutes
**Participants:** Andrew Furman, Gage Clifton
**Category:** Friend Catchup / AdherePod Business Strategy

## Summary

Gage proposes pivoting from a complex pill-dispensing device to a simpler RFID-based medication tracking system. Discussion covers product strategy, business model, go-to-market via Medicare Advantage plans, data as the core asset, onboarding friction, fundraising, and upcoming investor meetings.

## Key Topics

### 1. Product Pivot: RFID Pill Tracking vs. Dispensing

- **Problem with dispensing:** FDA approval is a long road, humidity considerations, high complexity, existing competitors at high price points.
- **Proposed solution:** Ship a cheap Android tablet in a case/stand as a home fixture. Include an RFID "brick" device — user puts an RFID sticker on each pill bottle cap and taps the cap to the device each time they take a pill.
- **Benefits:** Avoids FDA liability (purely external tracker, not dispensing). Simple, low-cost, just logs when meds are taken.
- **Andrew's counter:** For a near-term demo, use the tablet camera to visually detect pill-taking (already built). RFID hardware is the right v2 but camera works today.
- **Future vision:** Concierge service that receives medications and repackages them into easy-open bags (like supplement companies do).

### 2. Business Model & Pricing

- **Target customer:** Medicare Advantage plans.
- **Pricing:** $10 per member per month (PMPM). Insurance company provides the device free to members.
- **Go-to-market:** Zero risk to payer until value is proven — start with their highest-risk populations (COPD, end-stage renal disease, diabetics).
- **Value proof:** Compare medication adherence rates against the plan's existing baseline for high-risk members.
- **Long game:** Build a data flywheel. The real asset is the health data collected through the device, not the device itself.

### 3. Data Strategy

- **Data collection methods:**
  - Voice conversations capture health info passively.
  - Camera captures prescriptions, pill bottles, after-visit summaries from doctors.
  - Eventually direct EHR integrations (Epic, Cerner) — but that's a 10-year project, so don't focus on it now. Put it on the marketing slide anyway.
- **Monetization:** Could eventually sell anonymized data (comparable to how a PE fund bought a pet genetics company just for the data IP).
- **Alternative model:** Give the device away for free to all senior citizens, own the data. "Free AI companions for all senior citizens in America."

### 4. Onboarding — Zero Friction

- **Key insight:** Onboarding friction is the biggest barrier for elderly users.
- **Proposed flow:**
  1. Doctor/insurance says patient wants the device.
  2. Collect name and address on the back end.
  3. Pre-create account, pre-load tablet with login credentials.
  4. Ship via FedEx with an LTE antenna (no Wi-Fi setup needed — seniors can't do that).
  5. User takes it out of the box, presses ON, presses one button to start talking.
- **Result:** Literally zero setup required by the user.

### 5. Compliance & HIPAA

- **Gage's question:** Do we need HIPAA if it's just tracking/notifications?
- **Andrew's position:** Yes, be HIPAA compliant — we're storing medical information (voice conversations, prescription photos, health history). Claim HIPAA + SOC 2 compliance. When audited, use Vanta.com to get certified.
- **Key message for pitches:** "We are HIPAA SOC 2 compliant" — standard answer to any compliance question.

### 6. Upcoming Meetings & Pitch Strategy

- **Gage's dad + business partner:** Meeting in 2-3 weeks. Frame as a consulting/validation conversation, not a hard sell. Get feedback on the pitch.
- **Gage's friend's uncle:** Former pharma CEO who had an exit. Introduction offered.
- **Gage in Florida next weekend:** Sponsor parties with potential investors — opportunity to show the app.
- **Action:** Practice and dial in the pitch before these meetings.
- **Pitch framing for moat question:** "We put a device in senior citizens' homes. They don't have ChatGPT. We are their AI-powered health companion. We have a hardware moat (device in the home) and a data moat (comprehensive health data no one else has)."

### 7. PWA / Native App Idea

- Andrew will make the website installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA) so it can be added to a phone's home screen with an icon — useful for demos ("check out our app, it's live").

### 8. Operating Agreement

- Gage raised question about equity/salary terms.
- Andrew's position: Don't get ahead of yourself on operating agreements. Focus on doing 20 pitches first. The agreement matters once someone wants to write a check.
- Compromise: Trigger can be "once Andrew is full-time" rather than a specific salary threshold.

### 9. AI Industry Commentary

- **PRDs are dead:** Andrew argues that in 2026, writing 6-page PRDs is a waste of time. Just build the thing in hours and get feedback on a working product. PwC's ex-Amazon culture is stuck in the old way.
- **Software Factory (Chamath's product):** Andrew told Chamath directly that the product "sucks" because Chamath doesn't actually use it. The UX friction prevents adoption — people just use ChatGPT directly instead.
- **Defensibility in the AI age:** Referenced a Health AI Substack article (Brandon, Portland) about OpenAI agent stacks eroding software moats. Business logic on top of data is the last thin defense, and even that is being eroded. Urgency to move fast.
